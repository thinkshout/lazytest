ToDo:
- Add type to output (node/doctor, media/video, etc.)
- Add a way to do an initial run, show results, maybe with checkboxes for each line pre-checked, ability for future runs to exclude those urls with the same code and/or the same error message.
- Way to exclude certain urls
- Way to include certain urls
- Count success/fail and write at end of run.
- Add configuration screen where you can enable different plugins etc.
- Consider sitemap and menus for url sources.
- Should I cache bust by clearing all cache at the start of the run or by including url parameters? Which is more reliable/faster?
